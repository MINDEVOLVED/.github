# Welcome to the official MINDEVOLVED GitHub home

Here you’ll find everything we open-source on our journey to make artificial-intelligence-powered software development more accessible, transparent, and community-driven.

## 🌟 Who We Are

**MINDEVOLVED** is an independent engineering studio headquartered in Sydney, Australia.  

We partner with founders, governments, scale-ups, and enterprises to design, build, and launch production-grade solutions that place AI at the centre of the engineering stack.

Our ethos are simple:

1. **AI-First Mindset** – Treat machine-learning models and automation as first-class citizens, not after-thought plug-ins.  
2. **Developer Experience** – Obsess over tooling, observability, and repeatable workflows that keep product teams shipping at speed.  
3. **Open Knowledge** – Share what we learn, how we build, and why certain patterns work—so the wider community benefits.
